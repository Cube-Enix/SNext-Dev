# SNext

An open-source Scratch console.

## Tell me more, please!

As you wish. SNext is made with JavaScript, the same language that Scratch 3.0 runs off of. Games can be sumbitted to it, and if approved, they'll go on a server which can be accessed via the included shop. You can then download these games or apps and play them offline or online through a little UI magic and our inhouse compiler, Vroom!

## What do I need to run SNext?

SNext is now an ElectronJS executable, so that means all the dependencies come packaged with it. That's a good thing for you, since all you need is that now!

## Wait a minute. Isn't this just Turbowarp then?

Well, not quite. First of all, SNext isn't an editor.. We don't have custom firmware to make games with, so you'll have to live with boring old [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org) for now. Second, this is a console. Not an *emulator*, a *console*. We have our own system, with our own code, that has its own features. Also, does TurboWarp have a custom server running to host games? Ok, maybe they do, but it isn't as cool as ours!

## Wow, this sounds fun! How do I add my game to the console?

You can apply for launch title status *right now!* Just head to [this link](https://forms.gle/Rbt1ELbr8HPgEh2q9). You can also join our Discord, [here](https://discord.gg/mqGKmRw9MY).

## Installation

Until the .exe releases, you'll have to build manually.

1. Download the files.
2. Make sure you have both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) ready.
3. In the terminal, navigate to `src/electron`, then run `npm start` or `sudo start`, if you're using Windows or Linux respectively.

Please note that you'll get an error, stating that there were no files to run. **THIS IS INTENDED BEHAVIOUR. DO NOT REPORT THIS AS A BUG. SNEXT  WILL STILL COMPILE SUCCESSFULLY.**
